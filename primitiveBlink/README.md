Primitive Blink
===============

## Objective

Update the code from the previous Blink example that you created so it does the following:

* Uses an array to define a blinking pattern
* Cycles through each step in the pattern at a 50 millisecond interval

## Challenges

* Have the pattern array be dynamically sized
  This would involve making a for-loop that puts data into the array.
  You should be able to keep track of how large the array is ( look into `sizeof()` )
* Have the pattern array sent to the arduino over serial from a Processing Sketch
