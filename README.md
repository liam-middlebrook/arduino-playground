arduino-playground
==================

A collection of various heavily-commented arduino sketches.
The goal of this repository is to generate a list of sample
arduino projects targeted towards students grades 7 and up.

## Projects
I have created directories with individual READMEs that describe
the object for each project and then also provide extra challenges
for the project.

 **Please note:** Not all of the extra challenges
for the projects will be easy. That's why I'm making them extra,
I've designed a few of them to use concepts that may stump a lazy
college student.

## Solutions
I have moved all of the solution code to the `solutions` branch.
Here is a link to the github page for the soltuins branch:
